### ANDI
ANDI perform bitwise AND between register sign-extended 12-bit value. For example: `x2, x1, 0b101`. It means logical AND between *x1* register and *0b101* value. As each instruction consists of 32 bits. Below I posted two photos of the frame that describes what the bits do. The information inside them is exacly the same, but in a bit different way.
