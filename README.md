_________________
In this project I'll put everything related to RISC-V. I learn this technology from scratch, so there may be a lot of simple things. I hope to avoid mistakes due to being inexperienced.

### Useful links:

1. Very important tutorial for me. It has five parts. The first three describe what a RISC-V is, the basics of assembly language and how instructions work. The other two parts are discussed implementation RISC-V on FPGA board (based on MAX10) using SystemVerilog language. This tutorial was posted in *Elektronika Praktyczna*.
