_________________
In this project I'll put everything related to RISC-V. I learn this technology from scratch, so there may be a lot of simple things. I hope to avoid mistakes due to being inexperienced.

1. Very important tutorial for me. Why? Because it's in my mother language and I had easy access to it :) This tutorial has four parts. The first two describe what a RISC-V is, the basics of assembly language and how instructions work. The third part is discussed how to write own siple soft core using SystemVerilog language. The last part is describe implementation RISC-V on FPGA board (based on MAX10). This tutorial was published in the *Elektronika Praktyczna* magazine. Fortunately, however, the first part is available online for free:
