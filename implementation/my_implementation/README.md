# RISCPOL
> Simple RISC-V (RV32I) core written in VHDL.

### Overview
Very simple single-stage RISC-V (RV32I) core for learning purposes (without 
SYSTEM instructions). It's written in VHDL. The aim of this project was to learn 
about RISC-V, for this reason the implementation is extremely simple, no 
pipelining, no interrupts, no branch prediction etc.
