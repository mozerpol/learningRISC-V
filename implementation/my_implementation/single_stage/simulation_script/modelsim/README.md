The top-level entity is *riscpol* in *riscpol_design.vhdl*. The tests are in 
*riscpol_tb.vhdl* file. <br/>
To run simulation in ModelSim on Linux go to folder 
*/simulation_script/modelsim* and run command: `do script.tcl` <br/>
After running this command in ModelSim the simulation will start, end itself and 
show all signals on the waveforms. You can add your own signals to the waveforms 
by modifying the */simulation_script/modelsim/waveforms.do* file. <br/>
I used Quest Intel Starter FPGA Edition-64 2021.2.
