In the three folders are scripts that automate simulation, for three different 
simulators: ModelSim, GHDL, Vivado. I wrote them under Linux (Debian), for 
Windows you can try to edit them, otherwise you have to do everything manually, 
i.e. add all files with the vhdl extension, compile them and then run tests 
which are in *riscpol_tb.vhdl* file. How to run them is explained in their 
folders.
